# On-body-Localization-of-Wearable-Devices

## Project - 1 

a) Implement different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques

There are 8 datasets : 
"Data1.csv”, “Data2.csv”, “Data3.csv”, “Data4.csv”, 
“Data5.csv”, “Data6.csv”, “Data7.csv”, “Data8.csv"

1. Using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluating the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation
metrics
3. Plotting (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and coloring them according to the
original class
4. Plotting (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and coloring them according to the
class allocated by the clustering algorithm

b) The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes. 
"world_indicators.csv"

1. Using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries
together
2. Using Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
3. Reporting the best clustering solution. Giving a detailed list of all the groups and the
countries included within the groups
4. Generating three different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points
according to the group. Example: “Life expectancy vs GDP”, “Infant Mortality vs
GDP”, etc.
